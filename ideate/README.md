## Overview
The application is simplistic in that the user only needs to type in the article, save and return to read their articles at a later time.

## User Stories
Users should be able to:
* View saved notes and articles
* Edit saved notes and articles
* Delete saved notes and articles
* Create new notes and add  articles

## Development Process
* Sought to find out user needs with respect to productivity online. Found out users wanted a free application that works as similar as competitors.
* Outsourced figma designs from Amal [https://dribbble.com/shots/11875872/attachments/3501130?mode=media]
* Designed Entity Relationship(ER) for the Database
* Build the Backend using Ruby ActiveRecord and SQLite3
* Built server API using Sinatra 
* Bult the Frontend using React and CSS and Fetch API
* Deployed the backend on Heroku and the frontend on Vercel
 

## Technologies Used

* Ruby and  ActiveRecord
* SQ3Lite3 
* Sinatra
* React
* CSS

In the project directory, you can run:

## Challenges

* Deploying to Heroku was a challenge as the backend application kept on failing. I managed to solve the issue and the server is up and running  on Heroku
* Rusty React skills which consumed alot of time trying to build the frontend application

## 

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
